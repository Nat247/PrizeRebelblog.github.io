      <p> Prize Rebel is a free survey website, where you can get gift cards from amazon, paypal, starbucks, gap and many more. All you need to do is take surveys. First you have to sign up, you can decide whether you want use your real information or fake information. Prize Rebel is a legit site. but, let me tell using Prize Rebel wont get you rich. It is only if you want some small cash on the side. And also sometimes you wont qualify for surveys. There is also the option to complete games and watch videos to earn poiints. Once you have enough points you can redeem gifts cards or paypal money.  </p>

       <h2 style="text-decoration: underline ; text-decoration-color: #0D8E97;   "><strong>My Experince using prize rebel</strong></h2>

            <p>I recently was looking for survey websites where i can get cash. I looked at swag bucks, pinecone reseach and Leo opinions and i wasn't sure if i should use it or not. I came across Prize Rebel from a friend. I saw the reviews and i decied to try it out. I signed up and typed in my information, and then I started to complete surveys. Some surveys were long and others were short. It depends on how much effort you want to put into this. Try it out for yourself and see if it's worth it. I started two months ago And redeemed myself an amzon gift card. I was so happy that all my effort got me something and i hope if you use prize rebel you would be happy.</p>
